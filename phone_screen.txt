tricky counting question

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	back[i] = k...
	then substring s[k + 1...i] has all equal chars
	next[i + 1] = z
	then substring s[i...z) has all equal chars
	then ans += (i - k) * (z - i - 1)
}

repeated, both recursive and iterative solution 
recursive: find max distance of a node under subtree is x, then the node will be delted at step x
iterative: do like topo sort
