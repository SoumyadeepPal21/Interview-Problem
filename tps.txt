second one I thought of hashing, but greedy two pointer solution exists(check the reply of first comment)

first problem doable





https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6381275/google-l4-phone-screen-by-anonymous_user-ript/

the above is string version, doable
harder version is https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-ramp/submissions/1780539048/






https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6375708/google-interview-question-phone-screen-5-etdn/
